## About ZenLedger
ZenLedger is a comprehensive cryptocurrency tax platform that simplifies the process of calculating, reporting, and filing taxes for cryptocurrency investors, traders, and businesses. The platform aggregates transaction data from hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and blockchain networks to automatically calculate capital gains, losses, and income for tax purposes. Available for both MacOS and Windows, ZenLedger addresses the complex challenges of cryptocurrency taxation by providing accurate calculations based on preferred accounting methods (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO) and generating the necessary tax forms required by tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions.

The platform's data aggregation engine automatically imports transactions through API connections, CSV file uploads, or public address tracking, reconciling data across all connected sources to create a complete transaction history. ZenLedger features intelligent transaction categorization that identifies different types of cryptocurrency activities including trading, mining, staking, lending, and DeFi transactions, applying the appropriate tax treatment to each. With audit trail documentation, tax loss harvesting identification, and integration with popular tax software like TurboTax and TaxAct, the platform provides a complete solution for cryptocurrency tax compliance that saves users significant time and reduces the risk of errors in tax reporting.
